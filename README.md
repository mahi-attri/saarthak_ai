## 🏆 Why I Built It – Hackathon Vision

India has 1000+ central and state welfare schemes. But millions miss out due to:
- Lack of awareness
- Language barriers
- Complicated eligibility rules
- Manual, fragmented access

I created **SaarthakAI** to solve this.

At **Code For Bharat Season 2**, where innovation meets social impact, we chose to build something that could:
- Make governance accessible to all citizens
- Break language and tech literacy barriers
- Use **Generative AI** to extract user profile and recommend the **right schemes**
- Provide real-time info on **where and how to apply**
